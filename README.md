A starter kit for Node.  A dev gift for my friends at MacLaren

1) Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine

2) Unzip NODE_STATIC_WEB_SERVER.zip anywhere on your machine

3) Open a CMD prompt or Terminal window from inside the NODE_STATIC_WEB_SERVER folder, or cd to it.

4) In the terminal window type:   node server

5) Open your browser to "http://localhost:3333/index.html"

Your new project is ready.  Here's how to get started:

jQuery is included.  Feel free to update the version depending on when you use this.

- Start writing your app in `js/app.js`.

- Write your application HTML in `index.html`.

- Add CSS to `css/style.css`.
